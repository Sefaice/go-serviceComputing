LINE1: Assassin's Creed Odyssey sets players on a grand adventure through an Ancient Greece rich with culture, conflict, and consequences. 
LINE2: What's your approach to creating music for a game of this size? What are some of your first priorities, for example?
LINE3: With today's technology anything is possible so our first priority is to apply a set of rules. We try to pin down what we are trying to achieve with the score, 
LINE4: and how we are going to do that, 
LINE5: keeping the sound unique and exciting, 
LINE6: yet consistent through the many hours of gameplay.
LINE7: Our first step on this path with Odyssey was researching the historical and geographical setting, 
LINE8: and this gave us an â€˜in' as to how we wanted it to sound: 
LINE9: Ancient Greek in flavor and feeling whilst still being a contemporary score.
LINE10: Is there an overriding theme you were trying to capture or create with the soundtrack? 
LINE11: A particular feeling you wanted to evoke with it?
LINE12: Assassin's Creed Odyssey is about family, betrayal and war; 
LINE13: it's a proper Greek tragedy. 
LINE14: e wanted the music to reflect that, to be able to go from tender and tragic, human and fragile to full-on epic battle.
LINE15: In between moments of grand adventure, there are quiet times when players are in transit or appreciating views or not on the attack. 
LINE16: How did you approach these mellower moments?
LINE17: We actually enjoy these moments the most, where silence and spaces are as important as the notes. 
LINE18: We liked to start these pieces by playing live, the two of us plus our collaborator Mike Georgiades picking up instruments and playing together. 
LINE19: By the time we were a few months in, we could channel the Ancient Greeks through our badly-tuned ancient instruments!
LINE20: When working with a big open-world game like this, is it important to give different regions distinctive musical textures? What kinds of things did you want the music to reflect?
